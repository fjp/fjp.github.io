Hi, I'm Franz! I hold a master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from TU Munich. Currently, I work as a software engineer at Leica Geosystems, where I develop advanced software features for high-end 3D laser scanners, focusing on scanning and imaging technologies used in the surveying industry. Previously, I worked at Oculytics GmbH, implementing AI-based machine vision solutions for industries like food production and beyond.

Iâ€™ve also had experience working on trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles. My passions include robotics, software development, control theory, and microcontrollers. In my spare time, I enjoy working on [mobile robots](https://fjp.at/projects/diffbot/) to combine and expand my expertise in these areas.

This project provides guidance on how to build an autonomous two wheel differential drive robot. 
The robot is equipped with a [Raspberry Pi 4 B](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/32858825148.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.5d232e8bvlKM7l&algo_pvid=2c45d347-5783-49a6-a0a8-f104d0b78232&algo_expid=2c45d347-5783-49a6-a0a8-f104d0b78232-0&btsid=0100feb4-37d7-453a-8ff8-47a0e2fbdef7&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_9,searchweb201603_52) running [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic) middleware on Ubuntu Mate 20.04.
With a motor driver and two actuators it can drive autonomously to a desired location while sensing its environment using sensors, 
such as a camera and an ultrasonic ranger to avoid obstacles. Speed sensors combined with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) are used for localization.
The project is split into multiple parts, to adress the following main aspects of the robot.

- [Part list](/projects/diffbot/components/) 
- [Assembly](/projects/diffbot/assembly/) of the robot platform and the components.
- Raspberry Pi 4 B setup using ROS Noetic, which will be the brain of the robot.
- [Modeling the Robot](/projects/diffbot/URDF) in Blender and URDF to simulate it in Gazebo.
- ROS packages and nodes: 
  - Hardware drivers to interact with the hardware components
  - High level nodes for perception, navigation, localization and control.
- System integration: combining the components.

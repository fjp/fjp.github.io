## Voltus and the Bauprogramm

Voltus offers a range of electrical components for our project, including KNX buttons, presence detectors, REG KNX devices, DALI Gateway for light control,
and KNX servers for control and visualization of certain states. With these components, we can monitor and control various aspects of our home,
such as open windows, temperature, shading, automatically close roof windows during rain.
Additionally, you can secure your home with the latest in locking systems and door bells from ekey and Doorbird, two leading manufacturers in the industry.

But that's not all! The Bauprogramm offers many great benefits to make your building experience even better.
As part of the Bauprogramm, Voltus provides several benefits.
You will receive 300 EUR worth of free shipping during the building phase and a 3% cashback on the total value of your purchases.
Plus, you will get one hour of "Rent-a-Techy" for free and a special price for the distribution planning.
And to give you peace of mind, Voltus offers a 5-year warranty on all their products.

## Planned Automations

With the presence detectors, we can control the lighting in our home automatically, providing human-centric lighting that simulates the human biorhythm, with warm light in the morning and evening and cool light during the day if needed. We can also set light scenes with the push of a button or through our smartphones. The home automation options are endless and can be programmed to suit the individual needs of the home owners through KNX ETS software, which can be obtained for a reduced price through collective ordering in the KNX user forum.

In addition to lighting, we can also enjoy multi-room audio, making our home a truly intelligent and connected living space.


## Conclusion

Overall, we are grateful to be part of the Bauprogramm and excited to see the endless possibilities of home automation with Voltus.

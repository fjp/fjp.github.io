Our home will be equipped with a variety of automations. Here are some of the highlights:

The Berker knx buttons will allow us to control lights, light scenes, blinds, and even room-by-room temperature control.

In addition, we'll have presence detectors from Berker that will automatically switch lights on and off in certain rooms like the entrance rooms,
hallways, guest bathroom, and even outside and inside for security purposes. This will provide a warm welcome every time we enter our home.
The DALI technology for light control with a DALI gateway from ABB will allow us to have dimmable and human-centric lighting
(that simulates the human biorhythm, with warm light in the morning and evening and cool light during the day if needed.),
such as LED stripes, spots, and traditional designer lamps.

Magnet reed sensor contacts, installed in our windows, keep us informed about open or tilted windows and doors.
These sensors will help keep our home secure beside other security features.

Furthermore, we'll have a multi-room audio system powered mainly by Sonos and Sonance with its in ceiling speakers,
which will allow us to enjoy music in the living areas of our home.

The network infrastructure will be top-notch, with seamless wifi coverage through multiple access points by Ubiquity and network plugs in most rooms.

We will have access control through new fingerprint sensors by ekey, doorbird, to securly control the motor locks for the door.
The weather station from JUNG will control blinds and roof top windows from VELUX and its KLF 200 through the VELUX API.
We will also have visualization options with Gira X1, knXpresso, or a Timerwolf server.

And these are just the highlights! There's so much more to look forward to in terms of home automation.
These features will not only make our daily lives easier, but also provide a level of customization and comfort that is tailored to our
lifestyle and offers an effortless, convenient and comfortable living experience.

The home automation options are endless and can be programmed to suit the individual needs of the home owners through KNX ETS software,
which we obtained for a reduced price through collective ordering in the KNX user forum.

With such a intelligent home automation system, we have the power to control our home with just a push of a button from our smartphones,
voice or traditional wall buttons ;-)
Welcome to the future of living.
